# Major Content 

### [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric)
Create mod base. Adds far too many features to cover here.

Mostly based in the automation of different things, but includes so many machines for automating and new materials that it's essentially an expansion pack for minecraft as a whole. Create mod has it's own in-game documentation - "Ponder." 

Create mod and **[Just Enough Items](#jei)** go hand in hand. Seriously, JEI will save your life.

### [Create Diesel Generators](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-diesel-generators-fabric)
Adds diesel generators, fuel, oil drilling and refining, distillation, etc.

### [Create Deco](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-deco)
Adds a massive amount of decorative blocks to Create mod, including bricks, decals, shipping containers, and a huge assortment of railing, scaffolding, ladders, windows, and etc. using Create mod materials.

### [Create Crafts & Additions](https://modrinth.com/mod/createaddition)
Create mod plugin that adds electricity related items; motors, generators, batteries, collectors, wires, all driven by normal rotation force from create mod contraptions.

Electricity is generally very difficult to generate, as alternators (electricity generators) have a high torque requirement and electric motors require a LOT of electricity.

Also adds chocolate cake. :)

### [Create Power Loader](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-power-loader-fabric)
Adds chunk loaders that keeps chunks on the server loaded and contraptions in the radius running, even when away.

Major Features:

     - Brass chunk loader: configurable loading range (1x1 to 5x5)
     - Andesite chunk loader: loads a single chunk

 - Chunk loaders work on the ground, on trains and on contraptions.
     - Toggleable in-game via contraption controls

 - Attaches to Train Stations for lag-friendly chunk loading
 - Reliable chunk loading and unloading

### [Create High Pressure](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-high-pressure)
Create mod plugin that adds the ability to automate diamond production from coal or charcoal.

"Create High Pressure aims to give you a seamless and bloatless way of producing diamonds reliably, with no mining needed. It is quite costly though!"
**"It is meant to be survival friendly and not overpowered in any way."**

Adds graphite, created from compacting blasted coal/charcoal, which when compacted in a superheated basin has a low chance of becoming a diamond.
Also adds the ability to manufacture netherrack by mixing it with gravel and lava in a basin.

### [Create Enchantment Industry](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-enchantment-industry-fabric)

### [Lazy DFU](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu)
Performance fix that stops unnecessary code from loading during startup.

"DataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with."

"As part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is extremely slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017)."

"All LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty."

# Libraries and API's

Libraries don't really have any clear additions to the game. They're generally just big dictionaries with different conde functions that other mods can look up and use - they only exist to make modders' lives easier, and that makes them pretty cool. :)
