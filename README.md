# Description
This repository contains a mod installer/syncing script that adds stuff to the Silly Gay Fishing Game.â„¢ 

**See the [Mod List.](#mod-list)** (Or, alternatively, dig through the files yourself. You can find them in the `GDWeave` folder.)

# Mod List
Yup. Here are the mods. Nothin to see here. Just, y'know, a bunch of mods. That exist. They're listed there, trust me. No need to scroll, you can just take me at my word for this one. They're there.

# Project Outline
1. Back up existing save game to be safe (located in Appdata, some-whereabouts)
   - (Where do I send the save backup?)
     - (Do i write another tool to recover the old save quickly?)
2. Delete existing mods from game folder
   - (User prompt to confirm?)
3. Download mods from repository
4. Extract mods from tarball into game folder
    - might have to account for whether the game is installed on the main drive or another one
      - would reallllyyyy not be fun if i had to please god dont make me do this i have no idea how to dynamically find a steam game directory
